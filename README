Prerequisite Software:
curl

install steps on ubuntu:
Use the following commands
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt install curl

Prerequisite Libraries:
libcurl
json-c

install steps on ubuntu:
json-c:
Use the following command
	sudo apt-get install libjson0 libjson0-dev

libcurl:
1) Download latest version of libcurl (developed using curl-7.65.3)
   in https://curl.haxx.se/download.html
2) Extract the downloaded file and enter the extracted directory
3) Use the following commands to install libcurl
	./configure
	make
	make test (optional, usually takes a while)
	make install (you may need to sudo this)

How to compile program?
make

How to run program?
execute the file in Face-API-Master/bin/innofaceguard

How to use the program?
When the program is up and running,
	- 'd' or 'D' key will detect all the faces captured by the webcam. The
	  program will locate the face with a rectangle and print the detected
	  gender and age on top of the face.
	- 'r' or 'R' key will register all the faces captured by the webcam to the
	  database. The personId of the face will be printed on the terminal
	  if the registration is successful. The last 5 characters of the personId
	  will also be printed on top of the faces.
	- 'i' or 'I' key will identify all the faces captured by the webcam.
	  The program will locate the identified face with a rectangle and print
	  the last 5 characters of the matched pid and the confidence on top
	  of the face.
	- ';' key will end the program.

Note:
		This is compiled using pkg-config. If compile fails, enter command

			pkg-config --list-all
	  
		and check if libcurl and json is included. Also use

			pkg-confign --modversion <library name>

		to check if the .pc file is up-to-date. If both of these checkout,
		you might want to use ldd command to check which library the program
		is linked to during runtime. If the program is not linking to the
		desired library, copy the library you want to the location shown by
		ldd.

Bugs:
		1) Valgrind might throw 3 errors each stating that 8 uninitialized bytes
		are used. This is OpenSSL's bug and is patched in the 1.1.0 version.
		Details about this can be found in this link:

			https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/1117

		2) When calling curl_url_get(), developer might need to set the 
		CURLU_NON_SUPPORT_SCHEME flag for the curl_url_get to return the
		url.
